## Workshop on using generative models

 **Lisbon, 7, 8 May, 2025**


## Our learning goals:

 - Learn how to use simulation tools to solve and understand statistical models.
 - Go over examples of experimental design using generative models.  
 - Use different R packages to 

## Prerequisites:

- Some statistical know-how and R and RStudio installed on your laptops.
- Some useful buzzwords and acronyms to look up in case: 

 GOF: *Goodness of Fit*
 
 MCMC: *Markov chain Monte Carlo*
 
 ABC: *Approximate Bayesian Computation*
 
 Random generation: From uniform and non-uniform distributions.
 
 Mixtures: Finite combinations of known distributions
 
 Hierarchical Models: Infinite mixtures
 
 GANs: [Generative Adversarial network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network)
 
 Identifiability
 
 GMM : Generalized Mixed Models
