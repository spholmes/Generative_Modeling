# Background & Motivation  
- **Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC):** inference when likelihood is intractable by comparing observed vs. simulated summaries.

- **Deep implicit samplers (GANs & AVB):** learn to generate samples without explicit likelihoods via adversarial training 

- **Goal:** Combine ABC’s principled Bayesian framework with GAN‐style samplers to draw posterior samples efficiently

# B-GAN Sampler Overview  
- **Conditional GAN mapping:** learn deterministic map $G_\phi(z, x_{\text{obs}})$ from noise $z$ and observed data to latent parameters 

- **Adversarial objective:** train discriminator $D_\psi$ to distinguish true ABC draws $\theta \sim p(\theta\mid x_{\text{obs}})$ from generated $\theta'=G_\phi(z)$ 

- **Posterior sampling:** once $G_\phi$ is trained, draw $z\sim p_z$ and compute $\theta'=G_\phi(z)$ for iid posterior samples at negligible cost 

---

# Post‐Processing Refinements  
1. **Importance Reweighting:** use data‐driven proposal distributions and assign weights to $G_\phi(z)$ to correct discrepancies 

2. **Variational Bayes (VB) Refinement:** initialize a VB approximation from $G_\phi$ samples and optimize ELBO to further tighten the posterior approximation 
---

# Theoretical Guarantees  
- **Total variation convergence:** under certain capacity conditions on generator and discriminator networks:
$$\mathrm{TV}\bigl(p(\theta\mid x),\,p_{\mathrm{B\mbox{-}GAN}}(\theta\mid x)\bigr)\;\to\;0$$
  as the network sizes grow 
- Bridges frequentist‐Bayesian analysis by quantifying approximation error in likelihood‐free settings 
---

# Empirical Performance  

- **Simulated benchmarks:** competitive with state‐of‐the‐art likelihood‐free simulators on toy and real‐data examples 

- **Efficiency:** once trained, generates thousands of posterior draws in milliseconds per sample 

- **Flexibility:** adapts to complex posteriors without hand‐tuned summary statistics
