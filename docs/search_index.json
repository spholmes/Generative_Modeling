Go over examples of experimental design using generative models. Use different R packages to 2.2 Prerequisites: Some statistical know-how and R and RStudio installed on your laptops. Some useful buzzwords and acronyms to look up in case: GOF: Goodness of Fit MCMC: Markov chain Monte Carlo ABC: Approximate Bayesian Computation Random generation: From uniform and non-uniform distributions.

Where is the interface with statistics? Experimental design, model building, and decision-making. The E3SM is used for long-term climate projections. 3.1.1 New Lingua Franca of Science Simulators have emerged as a general problem-solving device across various domains, many of which now have rich, open-source libraries. Where is the interface with statistics? Experimental design, model building, and decision-making. Splatter generates synthetic single-cell genomics data. 3.1.2 Grammar of Generative Models Transparent simulators can be built by interactively composing simple modules. Probabilistic programming has simplified the process. Regression b: Hierarchy c: Latent Structure d: Temporal Variation 3.1.3 Discrepancy and Iterability By learning a discriminator to contrast real vs. simulated data, we can systematically improve the assumed generative mechanism. 3.1.4 Experimental Design Renaissance Let’s consider a microbiomics case study: To block or not to block? Blocking removes person-level effects… …but increases participant burden. 3.1.5 Simulation to the Rescue How can we navigate trade-offs like this? Simulate! Simulators provide data for more precise decision-making. 3.1.6 Covasim Following the outbreak of COVID-19, the research community came together to build simulators that could inform pandemic response. * E.g., “What would happen if we held classes remotely for two weeks?” 3.1.7 Covasim Covasim is an example of an agent-based model. Starting from local interaction rules, it lets us draw global inferences. Statistical emulators mimic the relationship between input hyperparameters and output data, substantially reducing the computational burden. Inference and imagination: Statistical calibration grounds us in reality while generative tinkering encourages us to imagine. 3.1.8 What are we going to study ? Many examples, like showing non-identifiability, the evolution of mimicry in butterflies, longitudinal study design, the duality between agents and particles, … * Paper Link: https://go.wisc.edu/833zs8 * Code (R + Python + NetLogo): https://go.wisc.edu/7222i9 A github repository of the material is available here: https://spholmes.github.io/Generative_Modeling/ "],["slides.html", "4 Slides", " 4 Slides NotBlackBoxSimulation Hierarchical Models Experimental Design Identifiability "],["labs-and-challenges.html", "5 Labs and Challenges :", " 5 Labs and Challenges : Find code for an example of a hierarchical generative model in the book: Modern Statistics for Modern Biology Install the package generative from the github repository spholme/generativeusing the packagedevtools` with devtools::install_github(&quot;spholmes/generative&quot;) Try out examples from the repository of the paper at: https://go.wisc.edu/833zs8 Code: https://go.wisc.edu/7222i9 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
